        <h1>WHO IS HE?</h1>

           with rap star and super-producer Dr. Dre.</p>

        <h4 class = "historyHeader2">From Zero To Hero He Went</h4>
        <p>Kendrick Lamar was born on June 17th, 1987 in Compton, California. His childhood was a rocky one. Being from Compton he had seen it all.<br> 
           Violence, death and drugs before he had even turned 10 years old. He was lucky to have both his parents there for him growing up because<br>
           the neighborhood he lived in was unforgiving at best. Kendrick was always considered a gifted kid, but without direction. All of that changed<br>
           the moment he witnessed the filming of Dr. Dre and Tupac's videoclip for the remix of the song Californa Love in 1996. This changed<br>
           everything for him. He described this moment as being life defining and this moment shaped the rest of his career.</p>
